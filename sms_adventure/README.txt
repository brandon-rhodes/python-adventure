This is a port of the "Adventure" game that allows users to explore Colossal Cave
via SMS messages. SMS-Adventure uses Brandon Rhodes' python implementation of the
"Adventure" game which, as Brandon writes, is "a faithful port of ... the original
1977 FORTRAN code by Crowther and Woods." All this package does is wrap Brandons'
logic in a delivery layer that receives and responds to SMS messages as game commands.
