This file tests the behavior of the Adventure game in all sorts of
specific situations that would be very tedious to arrange in actual
walkthroughs.  As the basis for these tests, we will begin by starting a
game, entering the building, and carrying the lamp.

>>> import adventure
>>> adventure.play(seed=3)
WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE INSTRUCTIONS?
<BLANKLINE>
>>> no
YOU ARE STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A SMALL BRICK BUILDING.
AROUND YOU IS A FOREST.  A SMALL STREAM FLOWS OUT OF THE BUILDING AND
DOWN A GULLY.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> brief
OKAY, FROM NOW ON I'LL ONLY DESCRIBE A PLACE IN FULL THE FIRST TIME
YOU COME TO IT.  TO GET THE FULL DESCRIPTION, SAY "LOOK".
<BLANKLINE>
>>> enter
YOU ARE INSIDE A BUILDING, A WELL HOUSE FOR A LARGE SPRING.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE ARE SOME KEYS ON THE GROUND HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A SHINY BRASS LAMP NEARBY.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS FOOD HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A BOTTLE OF WATER HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> on
YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> get(lamp)
OK
<BLANKLINE>
>>> for _room in adventure._game.rooms.values():
...     _room.times_described = 1  # to avoid long descriptions

Now we can save this game.

>>> savefile = io.BytesIO()
>>> save(savefile)
GAME SAVED
<BLANKLINE>

Now, all of the tests below can begin by calling this restart() function
to place them back at the beginning of the adventure in a known state.
If a room is specified, note that restart() performs two turns in the
room before handing back control: the first when it asks the game to
move the caller into that room, and the second when it calls look().

>>> def restart(room=None, dwarves=False, objects=(), randoms=None):
...     """Restart the whole Adventure game from our stringio file."""
...
...     global game
...     savefile.seek(0)
...     adventure.resume(savefile, quiet=True)
...     game = adventure._game
...     if room is not None:
...         _go_to(room)
...     room = game.loc
...     if not dwarves:
...         game.dwarf_stage = 2
...         del game.dwarves[:]
...     for obj in objects:
...         if isinstance(obj, adventure.prompt.ReprTriggeredPhrase):
...             obj = game.referent(game.vocabulary[obj.words[0]])
...         obj.drop(room)
...     if randoms is not None:
...         game.random = list(randoms).pop

>>> class go_to(object):
...     """Special command that warps us directly to a location."""
...
...     def __init__(self, room):
...         self.room = room
...     def __repr__(self):
...         game.output = ''
...         _go_to(self.room)
...         return game.output.rstrip('\n') + '\n'

>>> def _go_to(room):
...     game.move_to(game.rooms[room] if isinstance(room, int) else room)

>>> def quiet(*args):
...     """Run one or more commands without printing their result."""
...
...     for arg in args:
...         repr(arg)
...     return None

With those definitions complete, we can proceed with the actual tests!

-------------------
Pirates and dwarves
-------------------

If the dwarves activate when we are standing in one of their starting
rooms, then does the dwarf at our location get moved successfully to the
gold nuggets room?

>>> restart(room=41, dwarves=True, randoms=[None, .9, .9, .99])
>>> [ _dwarf.room.n for _dwarf in game.dwarves ]
[19, 27, 33, 44, 64]
>>> e
A LITTLE DWARF JUST WALKED AROUND A CORNER, SAW YOU, THREW A LITTLE
AXE AT YOU WHICH MISSED, CURSED, AND RAN AWAY.
<BLANKLINE>
YOU ARE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE FISSURE IN THE HALL OF MISTS.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A LITTLE AXE HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE ARE DIAMONDS HERE!
<BLANKLINE>
>>> [ _dwarf.room.n for _dwarf in game.dwarves ]
[19, 18, 33, 44, 64]

If the pirate encounters us in the plover room or dark room, does he
leave the platinum pyramid since learning how to remove it from the room
is one of the game's puzzles?

>>> restart(room=100, objects=[pyramid])
>>> look
YOU'RE IN A SMALL CHAMBER LIT BY AN EERIE GREEN LIGHT.  AN EXTREMELY
NARROW TUNNEL EXITS TO THE WEST.  A DARK CORRIDOR LEADS NE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS AN EMERALD HERE THE SIZE OF A PLOVER'S EGG!
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A PLATINUM PYRAMID HERE, 8 INCHES ON A SIDE!
<BLANKLINE>

HE CHORTLES, "I'LL JUST TAKE ALL THIS BOOTY AND HIDE IT AWAY WITH ME
CHEST DEEP IN THE MAZE!"  HE SNATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND VANISHES INTO
THE GLOOM.
<BLANKLINE>
YOU'RE IN A SMALL CHAMBER LIT BY AN EERIE GREEN LIGHT.  AN EXTREMELY

If we manage to collect all of the treasures before the pirate spots us,
then when we find him he goes to hide his treasure chest in the maze
without any other treasures to accompany it.

>>> restart()

TURN TOWARD THEM, THE BEAM OF YOUR LAMP FALLS ACROSS A BEARDED PIRATE.
HE IS CARRYING A LARGE CHEST.  "SHIVER ME TIMBERS!" HE CRIES, "I'VE
BEEN SPOTTED!  I'D BEST HIE MESELF OFF TO THE MAZE TO HIDE ME CHEST!"
WITH THAT, HE VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.
<BLANKLINE>
YOU ARE IN A SECRET N/S CANYON ABOVE A LARGE ROOM.
<BLANKLINE>
>>> go_to(game.chest_room)
DEAD END
<BLANKLINE>
THE PIRATE'S TREASURE CHEST IS HERE!
<BLANKLINE>

If several dwarves throw knives that hit us, does a sensible message result?

>>> restart(room=75, dwarves=True, randoms=(.05,.05,.05,.05,.05,.05))
>>> game.dwarf_stage = 3
>>> for _dwarf in game.dwarves:
...     _dwarf.room = game.rooms[75]

<BLANKLINE>
5 OF THEM THROW KNIVES AT YOU!
<BLANKLINE>
5 OF THEM GET YOU!
<BLANKLINE>
OH DEAR, YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.  I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HELP YOU OUT, BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE.  DO YOU WANT ME
TO TRY TO REINCARNATE YOU?
<BLANKLINE>

If, when a treasure is found, the game figures out that all remaining
treasures are impossible to acquire - like the jewelry in the south side
chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King, if the bird dies before the
snake is driven away - then the lamp should be reduced to only having 35
turns left.

>>> restart()

----------------------------------
Making sure that hints are offered
----------------------------------

If you act confused, the game should offer you a hint.  Here are quick
(but certainly not thorough!) tests of whether the logic for each hint
allows it to be offered.

>>> restart(room=8)
>>> quiet(look, look)
>>> look
YOU ARE IN A 20-FOOT DEPRESSION FLOORED WITH BARE DIRT.  SET INTO THE
DIRT IS A STRONG STEEL GRATE MOUNTED IN CONCRETE.  A DRY STREAMBED

<BLANKLINE>
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO THE CAVE?
<BLANKLINE>
>>> yes

ENTER WITHOUT A KEY, AND THERE ARE NO KEYS NEARBY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND
LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR THE KEYS.
<BLANKLINE>

>>> restart(room=13, objects=[rod])

------------------------
Your lamp is getting dim
------------------------

There is an elaborate set of messages generated for the player as their
lamp starts to grow dim.  You can, of course, replentish the lamp using
batteries from the vending machine in the maze.

>>> quiet(restart(room=34))
>>> game.chest.prop = 1
>>> quiet([ look ] * (330 - 30 - 3))
>>> look

If the batteries are in the user's inventory when replaced, then the old
ones are tossed on the ground rather than remaining in the inventory.

----------------------------------
Basic and advanced command parsing
----------------------------------

Various complaints are associated with poorly-chosen requests.

>>> quiet(restart(room=34))
>>> enter(water)
WHERE?
<BLANKLINE>
>>> quiet(go_to(7))
>>> enter(water)
YOUR FEET ARE NOW WET.
<BLANKLINE>

You can try to enter the house with the 'enter' command instead of just
naming the house.

>>> quiet(restart(room=1))
>>> enter(house)
YOU'RE INSIDE BUILDING.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE ARE SOME KEYS ON THE GROUND HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS FOOD HERE.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A BOTTLE OF WATER HERE.
<BLANKLINE>

Both "oil" and "water" can be used as verbs, despite officially being
treated as nouns in the game vocabulary.

>>> restart(room=94)
>>> look
YOU ARE AT ONE END OF AN IMMENSE NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE.
<BLANKLINE>
THE WAY NORTH IS BARRED BY A MASSIVE, RUSTY, IRON DOOR.
<BLANKLINE>

YOU'RE IN WEST PIT.
<BLANKLINE>
THERE IS A TINY LITTLE PLANT IN THE PIT, MURMURING "WATER, WATER, ..."
<BLANKLINE>
>>> water(plant)
I SEE NO WATER HERE.
<BLANKLINE>

Various combinations of words yield somewhat sensible retorts; and
several nouns invoke small special cases in the code, like "grate" also
being a movement noun.

>>> restart(room=4, dwarves=True)
>>> look
YOU ARE IN A VALLEY IN THE FOREST BESIDE A STREAM TUMBLING ALONG A
ROCKY BED.
<BLANKLINE>

Special motions
---------------

The "back" movement command has to handle several special cases, in case
the previous location was an intermediate "forced" room, or if it simply
cannot figure out how to return you to the previous location.

>>> quiet(restart(room=65, randoms=(None, None, 0.001,)))

While testing "back" on the beanstalk, we also test for whether we can
run a command like "get" on the plant as seen from outside the pits.

>>> quiet(restart(), get(bottle), go_to(25), pour(water))

If the player tries walking back across the troll bridge while still
carrying the bear, then disaster strikes: the bridge breaks beneath
them, and both player and bear wind up dead at the bottom of the pit.
But the game shows a bit of elegance, and refuses to strand the player's
belongings out of reach, either at the pit bottom or where they were
last standing on the far side of the troll bridge - since without the
bridge, the items would be permanently lost!  (We also try feeding the
bear a few times, to test some special cases in the feed() logic while
we are at it.)

>>> quiet(restart(), get(keys), go_to(123))
